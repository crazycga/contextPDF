A program to be added to the right click context menu to allow you to combine PDF files.

## Concept
I spend a lot of time doing financial things for clients that involve combining PDF files.  I'd like to make an open source, reliable program that will allow me to select a series of files (preferably in order) and combine them at once.

## Possible Features
- incorporate into right-click context menu in Windows Exploder
- allow for selection of files in order to have a "fast-combine" option
- provide options menu / window to allow "delete originals" option
- other items as time comes on
